TopoFramework
=============

The TopoFramework is a lightweight framework that is based on topological sorting. This framework provides methods to create modules (these are the computational units) and representation (these are the messages or data structures pass between modules). 

The framework allows to create  of topologically sorted graphs. As an example, we have given three graphs; two test graphs, and a graph that connects to Simspark server. The Simspark graph resembles the behavior of the test agent given in the documentation.

./configure
make 

./MainTopoFramework
